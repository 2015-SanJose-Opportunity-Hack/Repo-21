## My Path Mapping

#### Problem Statement
- Young people do not have equal access to quality financial services.  Too often, our low income communities and communities of color end up paying hundreds of extra dollars a year and thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime for basic financial services that many wealthier communities have access to. This app is intended to provide a toolset for MyPath to map out financial services access for low income youth and youth of color to identify the lack of access in those communities.
